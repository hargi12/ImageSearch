# ImageSearch
A basic Android application using Kotlin that lets you search the web for an ojbect just by taking a picture of it.

After the announcement of Kotlin as a first class language for Android I wanted to create a simple application to try out the language.
This application is created to try different parts of Android programming with Kotlin including Firebase, cameras, UI design, and permissions.

The idea for this application came from the fact that one day I tried to use Google image search on my phone only to find out that searching via images is only available on desktop.
Hence I wanted to make an app that would allow me to take a picture and search it from my phone without the need for my desktop

## Firebase
Since this uses Firebase it needs an api-key, and since I have locked my api-key to my SHA-1 signing-certificate fingerprint you will have to setup your own api-key when you build the app.
